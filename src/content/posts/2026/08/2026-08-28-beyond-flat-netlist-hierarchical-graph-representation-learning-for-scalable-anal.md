Circuit Representation Learning (CRL) offers a powerful paradigm to guide and optimize core Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, but its practical adoption is hindered by the immense scale of industrial netlists and a failure to explicitly model register-level temporal dynamics. To overcome these barriers, we introduce DeepSeq3, a novel hierarchical framework that abstracts circuits into a two-level representation: fine-grained combinational subgraphs partitioned by flip-flops (FFs), and a high-level Super-Node Graph (SNG) that models the register-transfer structure. A dual Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture learns representations at both levels, capturing local Boolean logic and global state transitions. Crucially, we introduce a state-centric pre-training scheme that predicts the reachability between FF states, endowing the model with a deep understanding of temporal behavior. Demonstrated on large-scale benchmarks, DeepSeq3's approach yields superior scalability and richer representations, reducing bounded model checking (BMC) solving time by 18% while guaranteeing correctness.
